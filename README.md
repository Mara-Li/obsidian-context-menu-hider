# Obsidian Customizable Right Click Menu

This plugin allows you to add any commands, including those of community plugins, to the right click menu and assign custom icons to them. This menu is available in Source and Live Preview mode, but not Preview mode.

## Custom Icons

If the command doesn't yet have any icon, you can assign it an icon from Obsidian's internal icons and Feather icons.

## Thanks
This plugin is a fork of phibr0's excellent [customizable sidebar](https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-customizable-sidebar).
