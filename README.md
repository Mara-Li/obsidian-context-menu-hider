# Obsidian Customizable Right Click Menu

This plugin allows you to add any command, including those of plugins, to the right click menu and assign custom icons to them.

## Custom Icons

If the command doesn't yet have any icon, you can select from a range of icons, including Obsidian's internal icons and all Feather Icons.

## How to install

1. Go to **Community Plugins** in your [Obsidian](https://www.obsidian.md) settings and **disable** Safe Mode
2. Click on **Browse** and search for „Customizable Sidebar“
3. Click install
4. Toggle the plugin **on** in the **Community Plugins** tab
