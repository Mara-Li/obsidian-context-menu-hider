# Obsidian Customizable Right Click Menu

This plugin allows you to add any commands, including those of community plugins, to the right click menu and assign custom icons to them. Note that this menu is available only on the note in Source and Live Preview mode, but not Preview mode or in the sidebars.

## Custom Icons

If the command doesn't yet have an icon, you can assign one from Obsidian's internal icons and Lucide icons. You can also reassign icons for commands with preixisiting icons by clicking the "edit" button once a command has been reigstered.

This plugin is a fork of phibr0's excellent [customizable sidebar](https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-customizable-sidebar).
